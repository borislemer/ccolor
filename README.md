## :cloud: Overview

CMatrix is based on the screensaver from The Matrix website. It shows text
flying in and out in a terminal like as seen in "The Matrix" movie. It can
scroll lines all at the same rate or asynchronously and at a user-defined
speed.

CMAtrix is inspired from 'The Matrix' movie. If you haven't seen this movie and you are a fan of computers or sci-fi in general, go see this movie!!!

> :grey_exclamation:`Disclaimer` : We are in no way affiliated in any way with the movie "The Matrix", "Warner Bros" nor
any of its affiliates in any way, just fans.

## 🎨 About This Fork (ccolor)

This is a fun modification of CMatrix created by **B.** that replaces the traditional characters with colorful emojis! 

**All kudos and credit go to the original CMatrix authors** - this fork was created purely for fun and experimentation. The modifications were made to:
- Replace ASCII characters with colorful emojis
- Test and stress-test [Cursor.ai](https://cursor.ai) capabilities
- Test Windows 11 terminal emoji rendering

The original CMatrix project and its maintainers deserve all the credit for the excellent base implementation. This is just a playful experiment! 😊

## :open_file_folder: Build Dependencies
You'll probably need a decent ncurses library to get this to work. On Windows, using mingw-w64-ncurses is recommended (PDCurses will also work, but it does not support colors or bold text).
<br>
##### :small_blue_diamond: For Linux<br>
Run this command to check the version of ncurses.
```
ldconfig -p | grep ncurses
```
If you get no output then you need to install ncurses. Click below to install ncurses in Linux.

## :floppy_disk: Building and installing ccolor
To install ccolor, Clone this repo in your local system and use the build script from within the ccolor directory.

#### :small_blue_diamond: Quick Build (Recommended)
```sh
# Install dependencies (if needed)
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncursesw5-dev

# Build
./build.sh

# Run
./ccolor
```

#### :small_blue_diamond: Using `configure` (original method)
```sh
autoreconf -i  # skip if using released tarball
./configure
make
make install
```

#### :small_blue_diamond: Using CMake
Here we also show an out-of-source build in the sub directory "build".
(Doesn't work on Windows, for now).
```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
# to install to "/usr/local"
cmake ..
# OR 
# to install to "/usr"
#cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make
make install
```

## :bookmark_tabs: Usage

After you have built **ccolor**, just run it:
```sh
./ccolor
```

Run with different arguments to get different effects:
```sh
./ccolor [-abBflohnsmVx] [-u update] [-C color]
```

Example:
```sh
./ccolor -ba -u 2 -C red
./ccolor -r  # Rainbow mode with colorful emojis!
```

For more options and **help** run `./ccolor -h`

**Note**: This fork displays colorful emojis instead of ASCII characters by default. The original CMatrix behavior is preserved when using classic mode (`-c`), console mode (`-l`), or xwindow mode (`-x`).

> :round_pushpin: _Note: cmatrix is probably not particularly portable or efficient, but it won't hog
**too** much CPU time._
